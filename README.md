- 👋 Hi, I’m @Samnji
- 👀 I’m a web application developer and a penetration tester.
- 💞️ I’m a python programmer, bash script writer and an ethical hacker.
- 💼 I'm currently learning about developing APIs and using Docker containers.
- 🏢 Some of my Django projects are private as they are real-world projects that can be monetized.
- 🌱 I’m looking forward to collaborate with my fellow web application developers and pentesters.
- 📫 Reach me at samuelnjiiri625@gmail.com
